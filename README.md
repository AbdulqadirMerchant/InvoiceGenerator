# InvoiceGenerator
Created an application that generates invoices for different clients. It is capable of storing those invoices in a database and retrieving them and displaying them for future use.
The libraries used in this application are pyside6, pyqt6 and mysql.connector. Hope you like it.

I have used Qt Designer to generate the UI for my applications and then converted the ui files generated to python using the command: 
### pyuic6 -o <file_name>.py <file_name>.ui
